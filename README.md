Troubleshooting
Common Issues

    "Cannot start a transaction within a transaction" error

        This has been fixed in the current version with proper database locking

    Tray icon not showing

        The application includes fallback icon creation

        Add an fdm.png file to the application directory for best results

    Download errors

        Check your internet connection

        Verify the URL is correct and accessible

        Try reducing the number of threads or connections

    Slow downloads

        Increase the chunk size in settings

        Add more threads per download

        Check if the server supports range requests

Logs

The application creates a fdm.log file with detailed information about operations and errors. Enable debug mode with --debug for more verbose logging.
Technical Details
Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Controller pattern:

    Model: DownloadManager and DownloadDB classes handle download logic and data persistence

    View: GUI classes (ModernDownloader and FDMQtMain) handle user interface

    Controller: Mediates between model and view, handling user actions

Threading Model

    Each download uses separate threads for concurrent operations

    Database operations use locking to prevent conflicts

    UI updates are handled through thread-safe message queues

Network Features

    HTTP range requests for resumable downloads

    Automatic retry on network errors

    Chunked encoding support

    Redirect handling

    User-Agent spoofing for compatibility
